# Zen Roll

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice using Webpack and to dynamically create a restaurant website using JavaScript. 

## Description
Zen Roll is a mock sushi restaurant website that features sections for the menu, including rolls, sashimi, and specials. The site showcases a minimalist design that emphasizes fresh ingredients and a serene dining experience. Through this project, I have implemented ES6 modules and created a fully functional front-end application that dynamically generates content using JavaScript.
